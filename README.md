  This was a group project I was involved in for my DS2500 Class.
  
My contributions were in the rating predictor and AI-generated reviews:
    - Created the rating predictor entirely myself with around 80-90% accuracy. 
    - Helped make adjustments to the AI-generated reviews in order to create comprehensible sentences.
